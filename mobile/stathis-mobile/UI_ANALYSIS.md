- **Issues**: Information overload, too many metrics at once
- **Target**: Duolingo-style progress overview with mascot, single focus per screen

### Exercise Module
- **Current**: Complex multi-state UI (Initial, PermissionNeeded, ExerciseSelection, ExerciseIntroduction, ExerciseActive, ExerciseSummary, Error)
- **Issues**: Too many states, complex camera integration, overwhelming interface
- **Target**: Simple exercise interface with mascot guidance, gamified completion

### Tasks Module
- **Current**: Tab-based task management (All, Today, Upcoming, Completed) with classroom selection
- **Issues**: Too many tabs, complex filtering, overwhelming task lists
- **Target**: Gamified task completion with mascot rewards, single task focus

### Progress Module
- **Current**: Tab-based progress (Achievements, Badges, Leaderboard) with complex metrics
- **Issues**: Data-heavy interface, too many progress indicators
- **Target**: Visual progress with mascot celebrations, simplified achievements

### Vitals Module
- **Current**: Complex health tracking with Health Connect integration, real-time and history tabs
- **Issues**: Technical complexity, overwhelming health data
- **Target**: Simple health tracking with mascot motivation, gamified wellness

### Profile Module

## Current UI Pain Points Identified

1. **Navigation Overload**: 5 bottom navigation tabs create decision paralysis
2. **Information Density**: Too many metrics and data points on single screens
3. **Complex State Management**: Multiple UI states per module increase cognitive load
4. **Lack of Gamification**: No progress celebrations or motivational elements
5. **Technical Complexity**: Complex integrations (camera, health data) without simplification
6. **No Personality**: Missing mascot character to guide and motivate students
7. **Inconsistent Design**: Different patterns across modules
8. **Overwhelming CTAs**: Too many action buttons and options per screen

## Design Principles (Duolingo-inspired)
1. **Simplicity**: Big text, minimal CTAs
2. **Gamification**: Progress bars, achievements, mascot interactions
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: One main action per screen
4. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate rewards and celebrations
5. **Mascot Integration**: Guide, motivate, and celebrate with user

## Proposed New Navigation Structure
