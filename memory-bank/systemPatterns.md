# System Patterns

## Coding Patterns
[2025-05-23 18:11:00] - Environment Variables: Using .env files for configuration
[2025-05-24 23:59:00] - DTO Pattern: Data Transfer Objects separate API contracts from domain entities
[2025-05-24 23:59:00] - Repository Pattern: Spring Data JPA interfaces provide data access abstraction

[2025-05-24 23:59:00] - Hibernate/JPA: ORM for database operations with entity lifecycle management

## Database Patterns
[2025-05-24 23:59:00] - Connection Pooling: HikariCP for efficient database connection management
